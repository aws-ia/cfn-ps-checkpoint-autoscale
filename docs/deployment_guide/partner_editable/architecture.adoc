image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the private subnets:
** CloudGuard Security Gateways in an Auto Scaling group.
** Either an external Application Load Balancer that operates at the application layer or a Network Load Balancer that operates at the transport level, to route traffic from the internet to the CloudGuard Security Gateways.
** An optional Auto Scaling group of web servers.
*** If you choose to deploy your workload of web servers, an internal Application Load Balancer, to route traffic from the Security Gateways to your workload.
* In the public subnets:
** An optional, preconfigured CloudGuard Security Management Server, to manage the Security Gateways.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
