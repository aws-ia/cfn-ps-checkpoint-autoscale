The Check Point CloudGuard Security Gateways, which are launched by the Auto Scaling group, and the optional Check Point CloudGuard Security Management Server, require a license.

Because this deployment uses Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) from AWS Marketplace, you must subscribe to Check Point CloudGuard in AWS Marketplace before you launch. There are two licensing options: Pay As You Go (PAYG) and Bring Your Own License (BYOL). See the predeployment steps deployment section for details and links.

To purchase BYOL licenses, contact https://www.checkpoint.com/contact-sales/[Check Point Sales]. If you already have a BYOL license and you’d like to use it for this deployment, visit the https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk112575#Licensing[Licensing section] of Check Point’s CloudGuard Auto Scaling in AWS documentation.
